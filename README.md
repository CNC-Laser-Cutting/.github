## What is CNC Laser Cutting?  
CNC laser cutting is a **computer-controlled process** that uses a high-powered laser beam to cut or engrave materials with extreme accuracy. **CNC (Computer Numerical Control)** means the cutting path is programmed digitally using specialized software.  

### How It Works:  
- The laser beam is focused through a lens onto the material.  
- The beam **melts, burns, or vaporizes** the material to create precise cuts or designs.
